Here is what I want to do. I'm taking a strict MVC design pattern to build an investment balance tracking system (web application) with php and mysql from scratch. I currently have the database, mysqli helper class, the basic member login module and business creation module built up. Below are the structured core files for your reference.
Obviously I have a partials folder in the v folder with footer.php and header.php in it, but I won't list here.
Please analyze the database, all of the php files in the mvc file structure mentioned above, then write the funding module for this investment tracking system, such that only the user has a role as f can fund a business. Remember, you should take the strict mvc design approach, with that siad, you may need to create a Funding model file in the m folder, a FundingController controller file in the c folder, and create a funding folder which include the funding view files in the v folder. Also you should consider the logic and workflow with other files, but these are just my thinking, you can just try your best to make a good funding module that's pluggable, extensible and flexible for this investment tracking system. Now, I've finished my message, please write  this funding module for me, the file names should be short but meaningful.</div></div></div></div></div>

I do not need a user with role as r, which is specified in the role field of member table to create records. I need the features such that when a business was created, it will specify a target grand total for the funding, like 100000 for example. For all the fundings from a given user they will get different permissions, privileges and potential rights by how much shares they have. The total share is obviously all the fundings a user has funded into a unique business dividing the target grand total. If a user has 10% of the shares, they can then apply to be a candidate, if a user has 1% of the shares, they can then have the right to vote, and it's inclusive, meaning if a user has 10% of the shares they can have the right to vote as well, but not vise versa. With these prerequisites and conditions setup when a specific business was created, we can make the record module more robust and purposeful, such that only approved candidates can create records. Remember that we have specified if a user has 10% of the shares, they can then apply to be a candidate at business creation, after they've been approved by the business owner or approved through a voting mechanism they can then create records.

These are my ideas and needed features, please analyze the structure, the workflow and logics within this Investment Tracking System we have built-up so far, then give me your best suggestions and recommendations.

These can be done with pure php scripts by conditionals or logics, or to make it possible by modifying the database stables, you decide it for the best outcome and compliance with the mvc structure. Notice that, I have a settings table reserved for extensibility and flexibility of my Investment Tracking System, and there are extra_info field with json type in business, funding and records tables, you can choose what to do and how to do with these existing structure whenever possible.

Now, first tell me your understanding of my requirements to make sure we are on the same page, then follow my instruction to do the actual coding, mainly for rewriting the record module.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Sure, let me summarize my understanding of your requirements:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Business Creation</strong>: When a business is created, it has a specified target grand total for funding (e.g., 100,000).</p></li><li><p><strong>Funding and Shares</strong>: Users can fund businesses. The proportion of total funding a user has contributed to a business gives them "shares" in that business. For example, if a user has funded $10,000 to a business with a total target funding of $100,000, they have a 10% share.</p></li><li><p><strong>Share-based Privileges</strong>: These shares then define the user's privileges in relation to the business:</p><ul><li>A user with a 10% share or more can apply to be a candidate to create records for that business.</li><li>A user with a 1% share or more can vote for candidates.</li><li>These privileges are cumulative, meaning a user with a 10% share can also vote.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Candidates</strong>: Candidates need to be approved by either the business owner or through a voting mechanism. Once approved, they can create records for the business.</p></li><li><p><strong>Record Creation</strong>: Only approved candidates can create records for a business.</p></li></ol><p>Based on these requirements, we need to make several modifications to both the database structure and the code. Here's my initial thoughts:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Database Structure</strong>: We need to track the total funding target for each business, the total amount funded by each user for each business, and the candidate status of each user for each business. We can do this by adding fields to the <code>business</code> table (for funding target), <code>funding</code> table (for the amount funded by users), and a new table (let's call it <code>candidates</code>) to store the candidate status of each user for each business.</p></li><li><p><strong>Business Model and Controller</strong>: We need to modify the business creation feature to include specifying the target funding, and calculate the share of each user when a new funding is created. We should also create features to apply for becoming a candidate, approve candidates, and check whether a user is an approved candidate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Record Model and Controller</strong>: We need to modify the record creation feature to check if a user is an approved candidate before allowing them to create a record.</p></li><li><p><strong>Voting Mechanism</strong>: We need a mechanism for users to vote for candidates. This could be a new table (let's call it <code>votes</code>), and corresponding model and controller features.</p></li></ol><p>This is just a general plan, and more adjustments might be needed as we proceed with the implementation. Let me know if this plan matches with your requirements and thoughts. Once we are aligned, I can proceed to provide more detailed modifications and code.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Your understanding of my requirements is right on point, but your solutions are difficult to carry out. First I want to make sure can you do all of these without violate my existing structure, I do not want to create new tables or make new fields in my existing tables.

These can be used to store additional information without requiring alterations to your existing database schema. Here's how I propose to do it:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Grand total target for funding</strong>: This can be stored in the <code>extra_info</code> JSON field of the <code>business</code> table. When creating a new business, the business owner can specify this target.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shares owned by users</strong>: The <code>extra_info</code> field in the <code>funding</code> table can be utilized to store the percentage of shares owned by a user in a specific business. This is calculated based on the total amount they have funded into that business divided by the target grand total funding for the business. This would need to be updated whenever new funding is added.</p></li><li><p><strong>Privileges based on share ownership</strong>: These privileges can be handled using PHP conditional logic within the code. For example, when a user attempts to apply to be a candidate or cast a vote, the system can check the percentage of shares they own (as stored in the <code>funding</code> table) and determine if they have the necessary privileges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Record creation by approved candidates</strong>: To facilitate this, we can store the IDs of approved candidates in the <code>extra_info</code> JSON field of the <code>business</code> table. Whenever a record is to be created, we can check if the user is an approved candidate by looking up their ID in this field.</p></li><li><p><strong>Voting mechanism</strong>: The <code>settings</code> table can be used to store vote-related data, like whether voting is open or closed for a particular business, what decisions are being voted on, who has voted and how they voted.</p></li></ol><p>The existing PHP classes can be extended with additional methods to handle these new features, ensuring that the code follows MVC structure. The logic of the system will be handled by PHP conditional statements and the information needed to make these decisions will be stored in the database within the existing structure, primarily in the <code>extra_info</code> and <code>settings</code> tables.</p><p>Would you like to proceed with this approach?</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words">Yes, absolutely, please proceed with this approach by using the extra_info field and settings table.

You need to rewrite this record module such that only the business owner and users have sufficient privileges can insert data into the records table. Users have sufficient privileges are determined by Share-based Privileges as you acknowledged before:
These shares then define the user's privileges in relation to the business:
A user with a 10% share or more can apply to be a candidate to create records for that business.
A user with a 1% share or more can vote for candidates.
These privileges are cumulative, meaning a user with a 10% share can also vote.
Candidates: Candidates need to be approved by either the business owner or through a voting mechanism. Once approved, they can create records for the business. Please write the code for this voting mechanism as well.
Finally, Record Creation: Only approved candidates can create records for a business.
The workflow and logic should be feasible, because we have successfully built up the Business module for this purpose. You must take the MVC design pattern for writing these code. Now, write this record module for me, for the model, controller and view altogether.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>
